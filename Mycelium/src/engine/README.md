# APIS

> Apis are static sets of functions that are means to be used throughout the project to manage different things. They are not classes which are meant to be instantiated, but just collections of functions.

# Data

> Data structs are meant to be used to store and maniplulate generic data. Instances of these should be created but hey also have static functions meant for interacting with other data types or creating new instances from other data. These instances may be temporary or stored for longer periods.

# Objects

> Objects are long-living classes which represent more complex objects. These not only store data but also have actual behavior or state that changes with behavior. These are usually never temporary and are kepts persistent across frames.
